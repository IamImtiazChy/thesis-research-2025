        "This notebook implements a framework for maximizing assertion accuracy in LLM-generated test code. It covers data collection from GitHub, HumanEval+, and MBPP, test generation using DeepSeek and Microsoft Phi LLMs, mutation testing for assertion evaluation, and an assertion correction mechanism.\n",

        "3.  Evaluate the quality of LLM-generated assertions using mutation testing.\n",
        "4.  Develop and apply a model/technique to correct or refine weak/incorrect assertions.\n",
